## Education
1. Chongqing Normal University (CQNU). Sept. 2015--Jun. 2019. Bachelor.
2. University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). Sept. 2019--Jun. 2022. Master.

## Work Experience
1. City University of Hong Kong (CityU). Aug. 2022--Now. Research Assistant.

&emsp; project: "Autonomous Driving System based on Autoware.universe"

&emsp; Automatic driving consists of four modules, namely Perception, Localization, Planning and Control. 
I am mainly responsible for the mapping algorithm in the Localization module and the semantic labeling 
of the point cloud map in autoware.universe, which is based on ROS (Robot Operating System). 

* Used the NDT or SLAM algorithm to build the map and locate the car's position. 
* Used Vector Map Builder tool to label point cloud maps (PCD) to generate semantic maps (Lanelet2). 
* Researched on object detection and lane detection using point cloud and visual data in the perception module.
